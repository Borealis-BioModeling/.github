## Welcome 

Welcome to the Borealis BioModeling GitHub Organization! I'm [Blake A. Wilson, PhD](https://blakeaw.github.io/), and this is where I organize my work on open-source bio-modeling and data analysis software. With these tools, I aim to empower researchers and small drug discovery teams with adaptive open-source bio-modeling and data analysis software. I can also offer custom solutions and expert consulting to help you meet your modeling and analysis needs.

I'd love to hear from you if you're interested in the software tools I'm developing or discussing other potential collaborations! You can contact me at [blakeawilson.phd@gmail.com](mailto:blakeawilson.phd@gmail.com) or connect with me on LinkedIn: [linkedin/blakewilson3](https://www.linkedin.com/in/blakewilson3/). 

Be sure to check out the [Borealis BioModeling GitHub repositories](https://github.com/orgs/Borealis-BioModeling/repositories) to explore my latest projects.

## Who I Am

Hi! Iâ€™m Blake Wilson. I have a PhD in Chemistry, specializing in theoretical and computational physical chemistry. I also have extensive postdoctoral research experience in systems biology and nano-bioengineering.

As a computational researcher, I've modeled biological systems across various scales, from the atomistic/molecular to the organismal scale.
My expertise includes molecular simulations (classical molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, free energy simulations) and differential equation-based modeling of biological systems and drug dynamics.

Check out my site, [blakeaw.github.io](https://blakeaw.github.io/), to learn more about me and my experience.

## Supporting

I'm developing and maintaining these projects independently without external funding. If you find any of these tools or related work of value, please consider contributing financially.
