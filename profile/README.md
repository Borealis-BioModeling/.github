## Welcome 

Welcome to the **Borealis BioModeling** GitHub Organization! I'm [Blake A. Wilson, PhD](https://blakeaw.github.io/), and this GitHub Organization is home to my work on open-source bio-modeling and analysis software. I aim to empower researchers and small drug discovery teams with adaptive open-source tools. I also offer custom solutions and expert consulting to help you meet your modeling and analysis needs.

If you're interested in the software tools I'm developing or want to explore potential collaborations, I'd love to hear from you! You can contact me at [blakeawilson.phd@gmail.com](mailto:blakeawilson.phd@gmail.com) or LinkedIn: [linkedin/blakewilson3](https://www.linkedin.com/in/blakewilson3/) 

Be sure to check out the Borealis BioModeling GitHub repositories to explore my latest projects.

## A little bit about me

Hi! I'm Blake Wilson. I have a PhD in Chemistry, specializing in theoretical and computational physical chemistry. I also have extensive postdoctoral research experience in systems biology and nano-bioengineering.

As a computational researcher, I've modeled biological systems across various scales, from the atomistic/molecular to the organismal scale.
My expertise includes molecular simulations (classical molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, free energy simulations) and differential equation-based modeling of biological systems and drug dynamics.

Check out my site, [blakeaw.github.io](https://blakeaw.github.io/), to learn more about me and my experience.

## Supporting

I'm developing and maintaining these projects independently without external funding. If you find any of these tools or related work of value, please consider contributing financially.
