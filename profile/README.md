## Welcome - Borealis BioModeling is Coming Soon! 

Welcome to **Borealis BioModeling**! I aim to empower researchers and drug discovery teams with adaptive open-source bio-modeling and data analysis software, custom solutions, and expert consulting.

Although **Borealis BioModeling** is still in its early stages and hasn't officially launched yet, I'd still love to hear from you! Whether you're interested in the software tools I'm developing or discussing potential collaborations, you can contact me, Blake Wilson, at [blakeawilson.phd@gmail.com](mailto:blakeawilson.phd@gmail.com) or connect with me on LinkedIn: [linkedin/blakewilson3](https://www.linkedin.com/in/blakewilson3/). 

I'm actively developing new open-source bio-modeling tools. Visit the [Borealis BioModeling GitHub repositories](https://github.com/orgs/Borealis-BioModeling/repositories) to explore my latest projects.

## Who I Am

Hi! Iâ€™m Blake Wilson. I have a PhD in Chemistry with a specialization in theoretical and computational physical chemistry. I also have extensive postdoctoral research experience in systems biology and nano-bioengineering.

As a computational researcher, I've modeled biological systems across a range of scales, including from the atomistic/molecular scale up to the organismal scale.
My expertise includes molecular simulations (classical molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, free energy simulations) and differential equation-based modeling of biological systems and drug dynamics.
